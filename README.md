# OFDM - LELEC2880 simulations
This git repository contains all the code and the report of the OFDM chain simulation for the course of Modem Design. 
The course was given by Jerome Louveaux (prof), Guillaume Thiran (assist) and Francois De Saint Moulin (assist) in 2020 - 2021 (covid year)

This repo showcases the work of Louis Delait - ELEC2M and Ben Delcoigne - ELEC2M

The project statement is given in Projet2880 2021.pdf. We invite you to read the report before taking a look at the simulations. 

Our code is separated in notebooks
	- BEN_OFDM contains the basic chain, was meant for testing
	- BEN_OFDM_Marre is some copy of it
	- BEN_Step1-2-3 Contains the actual code for the three main questions
	-Ben_Step3_MSE contains the code of step3 but adapted to make the required plots

Happy reading :) 

Ben and Louis
